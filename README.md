# jumble-solver

This is a jumbled word solver, written mostly in C. It is written in C mainly 
for performance reasons. A previous incarnation was written entirely in BASH 
and was entirely too slow. I have to admit that I wrote this a while ago, and 
so I'm not completely sure what all these components are, how they work, why 
they work, or if they necessarily even need to be in here. Use with that in 
mind.
